\section*{Abstract}

In this paper we are going to make a comparison between \Kotlin and \Go concurrency that is the main focus of the activity project for the \textit{Operating Systems M} course in the master degree in \textit{Computer Science Engineering} at the \textit{Alma Mater Studiorum} University of Bologna.

After a general description of the languages and their concurrency management, we will try to go into an experimental comparison between their implementation of the \textit{coroutine} pattern using a concurrent version of the matrix multiplication algorithm.
