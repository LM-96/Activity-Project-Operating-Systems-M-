\section{Introduction}

\Kotlin is a modern, multi-platform and blended programming language developed by \href{https://www.jetbrains.com/}{Jetbrains} that works on JVM such as \href{www.scala-lang.org}{\texttt{Scala}}.
\Kotlin is completely interoperable with \texttt{Java}\footnote{All classes written in \Kotlin are callable from \texttt{Java} code and vice-versa.} and it is \textit{object-oriented} with strong elements of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming}{functional programming} that make it more powerful than his father \texttt{Java}.
As specified in the \href{https://kotlinlang.org/#why-kotlin}{main page} of the official website, \Kotlin has also the advantages to be \textit{concise}, \textit{safe in nullability}, \textit{expressive}, \textit{asynchronous}, \textit{interoperable} and \textit{multiplatform}.

Furthermore, since 2019, Google has declared \Kotlin as the preferred language for developing \texttt{Android} applications, establishing it as the \textit{de facto} official language. As anticipated, \Kotlin supports also \href{https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html}{multiplatform} allowing the developer to write \Kotlin code that can be compiled for \href{https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-overview.html}{native} platforms (including \texttt{Android} and \texttt{iOS}), \texttt{JVM} and \texttt{JavaScript}.

\Go is an open source programming language developed and supported by \texttt{Google}.
It's an \textit{imperative} and \textit{object-oriented} language that is strongly designed for concurrency thanks to its very easy way to launch process and its efficiency.
The idea of this language is to maintain the run-time efficiency of \texttt{C} but with more readability and usability. Differently from \texttt{C}, \Go has \textit{memory safety}, \textit{garbage collection} and \textit{structural typing} as said by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)}{Wikipedia}.

In the last years, \Go also supports mobile platform (\texttt{Android} and \texttt{iOS}) as described in the official \href{https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Mobile}{wiki}, by writing \textit{all-Go native mobile applications} or \textit{SDK applications} with bindings for \texttt{Java} or \texttt{Objective-C}.
There is also a toolkit called \href{https://fyne.io/}{Fyne} that is free and open source that makes easy to build graphical application also for mobile using \Go.

From the concurrency point of view, \textbf{both of this language supports \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine}{coroutines}} as concurrent units of execution. \textit{Coroutines} are lightweight processes that can run over multiple OS threads, allowing to save on thread management costs.

Coroutines and threads are very similar, but the main difference is that the firsts are \textit{non-preemptive} (or \textit{cooperatives}) differently from the seconds that are typically \textit{preemptive} and scheduled by the OS. Indeed, the execution of a coroutine can be suspended and resumed by the developer, calling some operations, and not by the OS.

We will go in the details for both of this language.
