\section*{Abstract}

In this paper we are going to make a comparison between \Kotlin and \Go concurrency that is the main focus of the activity project in \textit{Operating Systems M} course of the master degree in \textit{Computer Science Engineering} at the \textit{Alma Mater Studiorum} University of Bologna.

After a description of the concurrency management in these two languages, we will try to go into an experimental comparison using a previously made projects of the author in the courses of \textit{Software System Engineering} and \textit{Mobile Systems M}.
